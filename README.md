<h2>1. How to install & run the project</h2>

  Firstly, you'll need to install git, composer <i>(composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP)</i>, something that can host the website <i>(wamp, Go Live, etc...)</i> and have a database
    
  Afterwards, you have to clone the project (https://github.com/B2-INFO-22-23/e-commerce-php-les-bests-benjou-et-jeremoux.git) and open the project
    
  Now that the project is cloned and opened, make sure to run the command:
	
	composer install
    
  Fourthly, create a file in the path <b>src/inc/</b> named <b>config.php</b>
	
  To finish, just put this code inside the file:
	
	<?php
	define("DB_HOST", "localhost"); // replace with your host
	define("DB_USERNAME", "root"); // replace with your database account
	define("DB_PASSWORD", ""); // replace with your password
	define("DB_DATABASE_NAME", "db_name"); // replace with your database name
	?>
	
Good job ! You are now able to use the website.
